Note
-- In the beginning, a file path for dataset is given as 'C:\Users\janu\Desktop\1001827251_project2\20_newsgroups' which will be different for different systems. So please kindly check the respective path of the dataset in the system and paste it in place of the path to view correct results. 
Dataset path is the most important thing in-order to get correct results.

-- Kindly please allow a minimum time of 15 minutes to view the results after running the kernel. As the dataset is humongous and will take time to load.

-- Execution in order (line to line) is important. If not, it may result in errors.

-- Kindly make sure that all the relevant libraries and version are installed and updated when opened in respective notebooks to run the code.
